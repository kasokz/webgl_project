# WebGL exploration project
WebGL project from computer science master.
This project was built in a course named "Interactive Computer Graphics".
The goal of this project was to help understand the concepts taught in the course in a practical manner.
WebGL was the technology of choice, since it's supposed to be easier to get started with, which I totally agree with.
In the past, I worked on a similar project in OpenGL and the learning curve was definitely higher.

## Demo
Live demo can be seen under: [https://kasokz.github.com/webgl_project](https://kasokz.github.com/webgl_project)
Since I used Git LFS, the .obj assets cannot be loaded unfortunately, since only the LFS indices are returned.

## User Interface
The user interface was mostly optional and was built using [Svelte](svelte.dev), which I really enjoy both for its concepts and performance.
